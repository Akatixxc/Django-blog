# Django Blog

I started this project just to learn django. I don't have any intentions to publish this website.

## Objectives:

### Done:

- User registeration and login
- Everyone can view posts
- Users can create posts
- Users can edit posts
- Users can delete posts

### Undone:

- Users can view profiles and edit them
- Users can upvote posts
- Users can comment
- Good looking
- Well functioning

## Currently

The homepage:

From homepage you can watch all posts, create post, login, logout or watch your profile. The sidebar is currently useless, but i'm going to figure some use for it.


Post:

Clicking on post you get directed to more detailed view. I havent yet made edit button for posts, but they can be edited by adding update/ to url.


Create post:

Post creating works fine. Currently you can make own slugs for posts, but I am planning on automating slugs. To post you have to be logged in.


Update/edit post:

As said i haven't created button for editing yet, but you can still access it by adding update/ to url, when viewing the post.
Deleting a post happens simply by adding delete/ to url.


Register:

Registering uses djangos built in user.


Login:

Nothing interesting there.


Profile:

Work in progress. Currenlty shows username.
